Goal Statement
I'm looking for business-focused roles that bridge strategy, operations, and technology. I want to work closely with users, customers, or internal stakeholders to understand needs and translate insights into execution. Ideal roles involve both analytical and interpersonal components — such as Chief of Staff, GTM strategy, Business Development, or Growth. I’m especially drawn to roles like Deployment Associate, Marketing or Growth Analyst, or Growth Engineer, where I can apply technical knowledge while driving measurable business outcomes. 

‘General Application’ roles should be rated highly. If noted as ‘Various Positions’, rate it highly.

I am open to most industries, except healthcare should be weighted lower, it is less appealing.
